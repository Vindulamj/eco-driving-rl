Signalized intersections in arterial roads result in persistent vehicle idling and excess accelerations, contributing to fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. There has thus been a line of work studying eco-driving control strategies to reduce fuel consumption and emission levels at intersections. However, methods to devise effective control strategies across a variety of traffic settings remain elusive. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to learn effective eco-driving control strategies. We analyze the potential impact of a learned strategy on fuel consumption, CO2 emission, and travel time and compare with naturalistic driving and model-based baselines. We further demonstrate the generalizability of the learned policies under mixed traffic scenarios. Simulation results indicate that scenarios with 100% penetration of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) may yield as high as 18% reduction in fuel consumption and 25% reduction in CO2 emission levels while even improving travel speed by 20%. Furthermore, results indicate that even 25% CAV penetration can bring at least 50% of the total fuel and emission reduction benefits.

#### Baselines

* V-IDM: The deterministic vanilla version of the IDM car-following model. It is a driving baseline that can produce realistic shock waves.
* N-IDM: Adds a noise sampled from a uniform distribution unif (âˆ’0.2, 0.2) to the IDM defined acceleration a. This is a driving baseline that can produce realistic shock waves and models variability in driving behaviors of humans.
* M-IDM: Developed on top of N-IDM model such that IDM parameters for each driver are sampled from respective Gaussian distributions. It represents a more diverse mix of drivers with varying levels of aggressiveness.
* Eco-CACC: A model-based trajectory optimization strategy.

#### Q1 How does the proposed control policy compare to naturalistic driving and model-based control baselines?

|        Model                 |    Fuel   | Emission  | Avg. speed  |   
|------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------| 
| Gain (vs V-IDM)              | 17.76%       | 25.38% | 19.95% |   
| Gain (vs N-IDM)              | 18.39%        | 27.43% | 20.56% |   
| Gain (vs M-IDM)              | 25.53%         | 33.38% | 31.94% |   
| Gain (vs Eco-CACC)           | 4.70%         | 2.98%  | -1.04% |

Time space diagrams of north-bound vehicle trajectories produced by a) V-IDM model, b) N-IDM model, c) M-IDM model, d) Eco-CACC model, and e) DRL model. Both Eco-CACC and DRL models demonstrate behaviors which involve reduced stopping at the intersection as compared to IDM variants. Both Eco-CACC and DRL models increase the throughput of vehicles during a green light phase by one extra vehicle as can be seen in Figure d and e. Figure f shows the speed profile of a selected vehicle under the five different control strategies.
